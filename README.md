**Problem Statement-:**

Create a store management system using nodejs where user can create account, sign in, login, see products available on store

Once a user wishes to buy the product he needs to pay an amount for the same, and the product gets stored to the user account such as spectacles

Users can do searching, sorting and pagination of multiple products based in price of products.

Once user create an account nodemailer notifies the user and send otp

Also when user buys the products email is sent to him

Use multer to add files such as power size for spectacles.

Also the user gets a QR code where he can see his entire details of the product purchased and his user details.

Admin can add, delete or update products based on availability.

Refer to lenskart as an example
